# A Better Start
A better way to start building a WordPress theme. 

**Based on _S**

**Uses WPGulp Workflow**

**Uses Susy for layouts ( Not depending on bootstrap )**

**Custom WordPress templates to start with**

I am building this starter theme to speed up building new themes. I see this project as a reusable theme which provides all the basic stuff and allows to add custom features and functionality according to project requirements. This is my first open source project, so kindly help me by suggesting any improvements I can make in any department.
